## Cooking data science project. 
## Given a list of ingredients, what are different recipes we can make?

The original repository for this project can be found here: https://github.com/jackmleitch/Whatscooking-/

Given a list of ingredients, what are different recipes I can make? That is, what recipes can I make with the food I have in my apartment?
 

You can run this model yourself using my API, in your terminal put:
```
docker pull jackmleitch/whatscooking:API

docker run -p 5000:5000 -d whatscooking:api

```

I have two blogs on this project also and they can be found here:
